# S-PLUS (Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey). 

The following routines correspond to the algorithms developed for the data acquisition of the photometric redshift pipeline of the S-PLUS survey.

Abstract: The Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS; Mendes de Oliveira et al. in prep.) is a new project that will observe 8000 deg2 of the Southern Sky in a unique set of twelve optical bands. The filter system is composed of the 5 SDSS broad-band (BB) filters, supplemented by 7 narrow-band (NB) filters covering the main stellar features from 3700 to 9000\AA. S-PLUS is carried out using a fully robotic 0.8m telescope on Cerro Tololo. The camera has a 9kx9k E2V detector with a plate scale of 0.55\arcsec per pixel and a field of view of 2 deg2. The NB filters cover prominent features in nearby galaxies (i.e., OII, Ca H+K, D4000, H$\delta$, Mg$b$, H$\alpha$ and CaT), offering strong constraints on star formation histories as well as photometric redshifts of galaxies. They are furthermore highly suitable for searching for low-metallicity and carbon-enhanced stars, the blue horizontal branch and variable stars, and for mapping the Galactic plane.
